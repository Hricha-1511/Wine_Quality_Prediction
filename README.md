# Wine_Quality_Prediction
The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to classify wines as either Good (class 1) or Poor (class 0) based on various features. These features include fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol, with the output feature being the quality.
