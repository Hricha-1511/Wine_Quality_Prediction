The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to classify wines as either Good (class 1) or Poor (class 0) based on various features. These features include fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol, with the output feature being the quality of the wine.

Multiple machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and SVM Classifier, are utilized in the project to achieve accurate wine quality predictions and maximize the overall accuracy.

The project attains a maximum accuracy of 93% after evaluating the performance of these models. This accuracy indicates the models' capability to correctly classify wines into Good or Poor categories based on the provided features.

The Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and SVM Classifier models all contribute to the high accuracy achieved in this wine quality prediction project.

In summary, the Wine Quality Prediction project leverages a range of machine learning models to effectively classify wines as Good or Poor using diverse features. With an accuracy of 93%, these models deliver precise predictions, enabling the identification of wine quality. The project emphasizes the importance of the selected features in determining wine quality and showcases the effectiveness of the employed machine learning algorithms in achieving remarkable prediction accuracy.
